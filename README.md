### 🌟 About Me

I am a **Final-year Computer Science Undergraduate** at NSBM Green University. I bridge the gap between creative game design and rigorous software engineering, focusing on building **production-ready applications** and **AI-driven solutions**.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a **Breast Cancer Prediction System** using Deep Learning (CNNs) & **Yaman Travels** (AI Travel Planner).
- 🚀 I specialize in **Next.js, Docker, and AWS Architecture**.
- 🛠️ I have deployed apps using custom **CI/CD pipelines** (GitHub Actions) and **Nginx** reverse proxies.
- 🤝 I’m an **Open Source Contributor** (Hacktoberfest 2025).
- 🎮 Creator of **The Pie Verse** (2D Platformer Game).
